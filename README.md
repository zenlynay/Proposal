# Proposal
Proposal for the final project.

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Great Snake Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Classic Snake Game with a twist. Make sure to grab a power up when available so that the snake can pass over itself once without dying.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be a classic game of snake with a twist. While playing, the user can receive a power up where the snake is able to hop over itself. It will be able to pass over itself once without dying after receiving each power up, and can continue to receive them after they are used. The power ups will spawn randomly after every 5-7 objects the snake eats and gets longer when eating other objects. The user begins the game by clicking and controls the direction of the snake with the arrow keys. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or moves into itself (without a power up)and the score goes up each time it eats an object.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Nina Perone: tul44843@temple.edu , Joanne Nichols
Sydney Jacob: tun58098@temple.edu , Joanne Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will definitely make a working game of snake with the help of pygame.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we will add the power up feature.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to add a start screen.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Nina and I will need to download pygame and learn and research how to use it with our coding knowledge. Sydney will research what sprites are so that we can use them to build our snake. We will split up the work and try to make it even, even though a lot of the work we will work through together.
